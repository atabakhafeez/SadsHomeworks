\section{Verification: Class Invariants}

We need to argue about the three functions. 

\begin{description}
\item[getSize] 
This does not change the value of any mutable variable and just returns size. Hence, the loop invariant holds here.
\item[push]
If an element is pushed, the size is incremented by 1. Hence the length increases by 1 and the size increases by 1, which maintains the loop invariant.
\item[pop] 
If an element is popped, the size is decremented by 1. Hence, the length decreases by 1 and size decreases by 1, which maintains the loop invariant.
\end{description}

The loop invariant holds for a new instance as well: $length(NIL) = size = 0$

\section{Verification: Pure Functions}

Using induction:

Base case: 
Using zero\_left and zero\_right rule from notes: 
$$ zero + n == m + zero \Rightarrow n = m  $$

Step case:
Inductive hypothesis: $ n + m == m + n $
$$ succ(n) + m == m + succ(n) $$
$$ \Rightarrow succ(n + m) == m + succ(n) $$
By inductive hypothesis $ \Rightarrow succ(m + n) == m + succ(n)$
$$ \Rightarrow m + succ(n) == m + succ(n)$$

Hence, proven.

\section{Proof Assistants}

I installed coq. I used an example given with the installation files. The Factorial defined recursively under /theories/Arith was run using the ide. I have given screenshots for each step of the proof check.
